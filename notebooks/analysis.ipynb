      "Given your medium risk for HIV (score: 0.44), the National Department of Health (NDOH) recommends that you access confidential HIV testing as soon as possible. You can do this at any public clinic, hospital, or through community-based testing services. If you have ongoing risk (e.g., concerns about your partner's health or recent potential exposure), discuss HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a healthcare provider, as PrEP is recommended for individuals at medium or higher risk. Regardless of the result, receive post-test counseling to address concerns and plan next steps. If you experience any acute symptoms (such as fever, rash, sore throat, or swollen glands), mention these to your healthcare provider as they may indicate recent HIV infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental Health Recommendation:\n",
      "Your mental health risk is low, but you are experiencing stress and uncertainty. The NDOH guidelines recommend basic psychoeducation and supportive counseling in primary care settings. You can access mental health support at your local clinic, where nurses or counselors can help you with stress management and coping skills. If symptoms worsen (e.g., persistent low mood, anxiety, difficulty functioning), request a referral to a mental health professional. Remember, support services are available and you are not alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrated Treatment Plan:\n",
      "1. Book an appointment at your nearest clinic or community health centre for an HIV test and counseling. 2. While awaiting your appointment, practice self-care strategies for stress (such as relaxation exercises, healthy sleep, and talking to a trusted friend or counselor). 3. After your clinic visit, follow the advice given: if HIV-negative and ongoing risk exists, consider starting PrEP; if HIV-positive, link to care for treatment; for mental health, continue to access support as needed and seek further help if your stress or uncertainty increases.\n",
